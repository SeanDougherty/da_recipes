Ingredients:

- Salmon filets w/ garlic butter from Costco (comes w/ 3 filets)

- 1.5 tsp cumin powder
- 1/4 cup italian red wine (I used the 2021 Montepulciano d'Abruzzo from Cantina Zaccagnini, you can get it at Costco. Comes with twine & twig around the neck of the bottle)
- 2 tbsp better than boullion (beef)
- 1 can of tomato juice (5.5oz)
